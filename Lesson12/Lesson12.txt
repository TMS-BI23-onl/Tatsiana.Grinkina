3.--Напишите скрипт для суммы OrderQty для каждого года и зимних месяцев из Production.WorkOrder в виде транспонированной матрицы:

SELECT YEAR, cast([01] AS nvarchar(30)) AS January, cast([02] AS nvarchar(30)) AS February, cast([12] AS nvarchar(30)) AS December
FROM 
(SELECT OrderQty, YEAR(ModifiedDate) AS YEAR, month(ModifiedDate) AS MONTH
    FROM Production.WorkOrder
) AS SourceTable 
 PIVOT
( 
	SUM(OrderQty)
	FOR MONTH IN ([01], [02], [12])
) AS PVT
ORDER BY YEAR
